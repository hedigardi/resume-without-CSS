After five months, I transitioned to a new role as a Training and System Coordinator for the customer service department, where I trained both new and existing employees. Additionally, I maintained various systems used within the company. I also updated instructions and guides and ensured that the customer service website, known as the "customer service portal," was up to date with all the necessary instructions and documents. After a while, I was involved in a project to develop a new business system for the company, which will meant to be implemented in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Estonia.</p>
